<!--
>- **Landing page** – Implement the landing page or home
page of the IoTBay application. It is the starting point of
the web application and should provide the options of
login and register for users.
>- **Login page** – Implement the login page using a web
form (e.g. JSP). The login page must post the form-data
to the welcome page.
>- **Register page** – Implement the register page using a
web form (e.g. JSP). The register page must post the
form-data to the welcome page.
>- **Welcome page** – Implement the welcome page to
retrieve the posted form-data from the register page and
the login page. The welcome page must use JavaBeans
and sessions to transport the logged-in user data to the
main page.
>- **Main page** – Implement the main page to retrieve the
user Beans saved into the session and display it. The
main page must provide a logout link.
>- **Logout page** – Implement the logout page for users to
use from the main page. The logout page must redirect
users to the landing page and terminate the session.
>- **Data model** – Create an initial version of the IoTBay
software application data model (JavaBeans).
